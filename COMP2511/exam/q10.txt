All software development is maintenance. I believe this statement is accurate to a certain extent. Although the first parts of the 
sofware development process include planning out the uml diagram, creating the task board, thinking of design patterns, 
and thinking of testing, that took the least amount of time in the software development process. In most of the project, 
I spent time refining, refactoring, and making sure that my code will work if in the future, one of my teammates wanted to add 
something new to it. Thus, maintenance is engrained in all design principles and design patterns, as they are there to help 
maintain the code for future use.
