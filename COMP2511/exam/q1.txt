a) The logical error present is that the code does not need to check if the obj is equal to this or if it is null,
since it already checks that in the rest of the code. (the return)
The only if statement it needs is the article instanceof, so that it can be typechecked. 
assertEquals(false, f(obj that is not an article));
b) The logical error here is you cannot remove any numbers from the numbers list you are iterating on.
assertEquals([2], [2, 3, 4, 5]);
