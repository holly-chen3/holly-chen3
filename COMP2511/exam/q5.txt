a) One code smell is magic numbers (i.e. 3000 and 2000). This should be changed to constants, 
so the reader understands what these numbers are. Another code smell is feature envy,
it is calling all the methods from the satellite class. This is indicative of a bad design, 
and should be moved to the satellite class. 

b) The code smell is is long parameters. This is indicative of design smell of high coupling,
as there are so many variables being passed in, resulting in a change of one variable leading to 
many other changes.
