b. Big design up front is not feasible, too many unknown unknowns, requirements adapt.

d. In software engineering, we must always write tests for the software before 
we actually implement it. This helps to make sure all edge cases are checked for
and determines when the prototype is perfect. Testing should be done throughout, not just
at the end.

e. Agile software development stresses the importance of iterative software engineering. 
As with any type of software programming, Object-Oriented Programming should also go through
the iterative approach - through identifying code smells and design smells and applying 
refactoring techniques to improve the readability and functionality of the code.
