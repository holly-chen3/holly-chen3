a. One problematic feature of the code is the protected variable
protected int x = 0; 
This does not align with encapsulation goals, which states that 
the internal representation of a class should be hidden from every other 
class. 

b. (i) Cannot go from more specific to generic for function return type,
this breaks covariance. (ArrayList is more specific type compared to List)
