Part A
The code smell here is the duplicate code of getBombs, getFloorSwitches and getBoulders.
In order to get rid of the code smell, we must use a generic type method.
With this generic method, it would look like: 
public List<?> getItem(String type) {
    List<?> items = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Entity entity: entities) {
        if (entity.getType().equals("type")) {
            items.add(entity);
        }
    }
}
Additionally, the redundant code if (item != null) {} does not do anything, so 
we should get rid of that part of the code.
Instead of if (!(item instanceof Bomb)) {
    return;
}
we should just do if (item instanceof Bomb) {
    ((Bomb)item).placeBomb();
}

Part B
The code smell here is feature envy, since the whole method is calling the methods 
from the same class of filetransfer. In order to resolve this code smell, 
I would use the extract method to extract all the code within the for loop to 
the FileTransfer class by making a new method for it.
