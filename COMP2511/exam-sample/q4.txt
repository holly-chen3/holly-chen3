Liskov's Substitution Principle states that objects of subclasses should
behave the same way as the objects of the superclass. 
Here, the inheritance shows a slight difference in the precondition of the classes.
The superclass has a precondition requirement of age >= 0, whereas the 
precondition for the subclass is a requirement of age >= 50. 
Through design by contract, it was noted that preconditions should not be allowed
to strengthen in subclasses. It can be weakened, however. This also invalidates
the liskovs principle, as although the superclass can use this method if age is 
for example 30, the gold flight cannot use the method.
