[COMP1511 Extension Work]

Write a summary of how you made the changes that you did:

[E1:Summary] {{{
I created a function called merging beats, which merges two beats given by the
merged_beats function, by creating a new merged beat which has the notes in order. 
In this merging beats function, I made the two beats equal to pointers a and b. 
I then called the check_lower_note function where I check which beat the pointers 
are pointing to are lower or if they are the same. 
Then I returned the lower note and copied the note,
in my function copy_notes. Once I have copied the note, I put the note into 
the new merged beat. In the function merged_beats, I then put the new
merged beats into the track, and discarded the old two notes.

Write two tests to test your implementation of Extension 1 (Merging).

*This test should *ONLY* test merging into 1 beat.*
[E1:Test 1] {{{
a 4 4
A
a 3 3
A
a 3 3
A
>
>
M 2 1
P
a 6 2
a 3 3
A
P
}}}

*This test can test merging into any number of beats*
[E1:Test 2] {{{
a 5 5
A
a 7 2
a 2 1
