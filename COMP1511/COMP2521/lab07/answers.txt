NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: Searching by Bfs, the while loop only ends when the queue ends, 
  which is the number of vertices that are put in the queue. 

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: Searching by Dfs, the while loop only ends when the queue ends.
