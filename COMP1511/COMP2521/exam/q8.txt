Question 8

Which of the given statements about tries (A, B, C or D) is false?
Briefly explain why the statement you selected is false.


B is false. In a standard trie, there are many words that can be prefixes 
of another word, since the trie works like that. For example, the word 
'extraordinary' has the prefix 'extra'. In the trie, the a in extra will 
be red representing the end of a word, and then it will continue down, with 
'ordinary' until it reaches the y and stops.
