Question 6

Which of the data structures is most suitable? Justify your answer.
You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.
A Max Heap is the most suitable. This is because the time complexity 
of adding a new element to the heap is O(logn), and the time complexity
of removing the maximum element (the root element) is also O(logn). 
Moving the new item to the right position always takes O(logn), hence why both
of these functions take O(logn) times. PrintInOrder will take O(nlogn) times, 
since it will be using the pop function, which is O(logn), n times, until
the priority queue is empty.
