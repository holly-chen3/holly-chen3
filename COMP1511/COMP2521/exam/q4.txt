Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.


Kruskal's algorithm, since it considers edges in increasing order and 
puts the lowest weighted edge into the minimum spanning tree if there is no cycle in the tree 
if it is inserted.

This means that it can insert the edge even if it is not connected yet with the rest of the 
minimum spanning tree. This is shown in the example, with A-E and C-D edges not connecting but
being inputted as edges.
