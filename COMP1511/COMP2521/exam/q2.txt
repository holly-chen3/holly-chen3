Question 2

Explain why the compilation error occurred and briefly describe how it
can be fixed.

The compilation error occurred because the Graph g is not a pointer to a struct, rather it is 
the struct itself. In order to fix this issue, instead of using the ->, use the . to access
the fields within the struct.
