Question 1

(a) What is the maximum input size that can be processed? Justify your
    answer.
The maximum input size that can be processed is approximately 20. 
2^10 compared to 2^10 * 1000 = 2^20. 1000 is approximately equal to 2^10 which is
1024. Therefore, it is 2^10 * 2^10 = 2^20.


(b) Which of the two algorithms is more efficient? Justify your answer.
Quad search is more efficient, as it will perform the task in O(log(base 4)n) time.
This is compared to the binary search which only performs one comparison each time, 
thus making the time complexity O(log(base 2)n).


(c) What are the time complexities of fnA() and fnB() in terms of a and
    b? Justify your answer.

The time complexity for fnA() is O(b - a) time. This is because of the recursion 
in the function is fnA(arr, a + 1, b). This means that the a will go up by one until 
it reaches b. Thus, the function will be called O(b - a) times.

The time complexity for fnB() is O((b - a) ^ 2) time. This is because the function calls 
fnA(), which has a time complexity of O(b - a), and then calls itself recursively 
b - a times. Multiplying the two together gives O((b - a) ^2).
