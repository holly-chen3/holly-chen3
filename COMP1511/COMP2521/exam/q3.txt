Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.

B. I drew the tree with the pre order traversal, where you traverse the 
parent node first, and then the left subtrees, and then the right subtrees.
After that, I used post order traversal, where you get all the left subtree
of the node traversed first, and then the right children, and then the node itself. 

(b)

Value in the root node: 32

Value in the left child (of the root): 20

Value in the right child (of the root): 36

(c)

i.  Value(s) in the root node: 20

ii. Value(s) in the node that now contains 62: 35, 60, 62
